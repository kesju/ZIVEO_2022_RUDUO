Often Taylor and McLaurin series are explained in the very\nfirst courses of Science and Engineering degrees, and students are familiar\nwith polynomials since much before. Thus, the monomial basis is useful for\nteaching purposes (and that is why we have used it in the examples). It is\nalso very useful for testing purposes, as it easy to manually derive the\nexpected results of operations involving this basis.\n\nAs a basis for functional data analysis, however, it has several issues that\nusually make preferrable to use other basis instead. First, the usual basis\n$\\{1, t, t^2, t^3, \\ldots\\}$ is not orthogonal under the standard\ninner product in $L^2$, that is $\\langle x_1, x_2 \\rangle =\n\\int_{\\mathcal{T}} x_1(t) x_2(t) dt$. This inhibits some\nperformance optimizations that are available for operations that require\ninner products. It is possible to find an orthogonal basis of polynomials,\nbut it will not be as easy to understand, losing many of its advantages.\nAnother problems with this basis are the necessity of a large\nnumber of basis functions to express local features, the bad behaviour at\nthe extremes of the function and the fact that the derivatives of the basis\nexpansion are not good approximations of the derivatives of the original\ndata, as high order polynomials tend to have very large oscillations.\n\n"
